# Smart Hydroponic System - Proof of Concept
This project is a proof of concept for a Smart Hydroponic Monitor and Controller system, developed using Django. It aims to demonstrate the feasibility of monitoring and controlling environmental conditions, nutrient levels, and other critical parameters in a hydroponic setup, all through a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- User Management: Register, login, manage profiles, and set preferences.
- System Registration: Add and configure multiple hydroponic systems.
- Monitoring: Real-time display of temperature, humidity, nutrient levels, etc.
- Control: Adjust lighting, water flow, and nutrient dosing.
- Alerts: Receive notifications for any anomalies or threshold breaches.
- Collaboration: Invite collaborators to monitor and control the system.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
1. Python (version 3.11 recommended)
